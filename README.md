**tasktree-manager** is a terminal user interface (TUI) application for managing development tasks that span multiple git repositories. Create tasks, organize worktrees, and track status across your entire codebase—all from a beautiful, keyboard-driven interface inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Task-Based Workflow** - Group related worktrees across multiple repositories
- 🌳 **Git Worktree Management** - Create, delete, and manage worktrees seamlessly
- 📊 **Real-Time Status** - See uncommitted changes, branch info, and sync status at a glance
- 🔀 **Sorting & Grouping** - Sort tasks by name/date/status, group worktrees by dirty/clean
- 🎨 **Beautiful Themes** - lazygit-inspired default plus 20+ themes (Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Nord, ...) via Command Palette (Ctrl+P)
- ⌨️ **Keyboard-First** - Navigate and control everything without touching the mouse
- 🚀 **Fast & Responsive** - Parallel git operations with loading indicators
- 🔧 **Flexible Configuration** - TOML config file, custom keybindings, environment variables
- 🤖 **Headless CLI** - Create, list, and delete tasks from scripts and AI agents without opening the TUI

## 📊 Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `●` red | Uncommitted changes |
| `◆` blue | Has CLAUDE.md file |
| `⟳` magenta | Claude Code session running |
| `!` yellow | Claude Code session waiting for input |
| `✓` green | Clean worktree / Claude session ended |
| `✗ N` red | N files changed |
| `↑N` green | N commits ahead of remote |
| `↓N` yellow | N commits behind remote |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Using pipx (recommended)
pipx install tasktree-manager
```

See the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) for other methods and platform-specific instructions.

### First Run

```bash
tasktree-manager
```

On first run, you'll configure:
- **Repositories Directory**: Where your git repos live (e.g., `~/repos`)
- **Tasks Directory**: Where worktrees will be created (e.g., `~/tasks`)

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create a task** - Press `n`, enter task name, select repositories
2. **Work on code** - Press `e` for editor, `g` for lazygit, or `Enter` for shell
3. **Review changes** - Press `h` to view the diff in [hunk](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk) (all repos from the task panel, one repo from the worktree panel)
4. **Push changes** - Press `p` to push all worktrees
5. **Delete task** - Press `d` when finished

For detailed workflows and examples, see the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md).

### Headless CLI

Running `tasktree-manager` with arguments skips the TUI — useful for scripts and AI-agent
workflows (e.g. a skill that creates a Jira ticket and then the matching task):

```bash
tasktree-manager create DIC-1901-argocd-tls --repos backend,frontend  # --base overrides the default base branch
tasktree-manager list --json     # tasks with repos and dirty state (plain text without --json)
tasktree-manager repos           # available repos in REPOS_DIR
tasktree-manager add-repo DIC-1901-argocd-tls infra
tasktree-manager delete DIC-1901-argocd-tls   # refuses on unfinished work; --force overrides
```

Exit code is 0 on success, 1 on failure with the reason on stderr. `delete` runs the same
safety check as the TUI (uncommitted, unpushed, or unmerged work blocks deletion).

## 📖 Documentation

**Complete guides:**
- [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md) - Platform-specific setup, system requirements, troubleshooting
- [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) - Workflows, keyboard shortcuts, tips and best practices
- [Configuration Reference](docs/configuration.md) - All config options, keybindings, themes
- [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

**Quick Reference:**

| Key | Action | Key | Action |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| `n` | New task | `g` | Open lazygit |
| `a` | Add repo | `h` | Show diff (hunk) |
| `d` | Delete task | `e` | Open editor |
| `p` | Push all | `o` | Open folder |
| `P` | Pull all | `Enter` | Open shell |
| `c` | Claude (resume) | `C` | Claude (new) |
| `r` | Refresh | `s` | Sort tasks |
| `S` | Group worktrees | `m` | Messages |
| `t` | Cycle theme | `Tab` | Next panel |
| `?` | Show help | `q` | Quit |

**Themes:** The default `tasktree` theme pairs a lazygit-classic ANSI palette with layered panels, numbered title bars, green focus borders, and a keycap footer. Five more design-system palettes ship tuned to the same shape — tokyo-night, catppuccin-mocha, gruvbox, dracula, nord — and every other Textual built-in theme works too (`Ctrl+P` to switch); the whole UI is styled with Textual design tokens, so any theme restyles it consistently.

## 🏗️ How It Works

tasktree-manager uses [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to create isolated working directories for each task. Work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or context switching.

**Directory Structure:**
```
~/repos/                    # Your git repositories (never modified)
  ├── backend/
  └── frontend/

~/tasks/                    # Task worktrees (managed by tasktree-manager)
  ├── FEAT-123/
  │   ├── backend/          # Worktree on branch FEAT-123
  │   └── frontend/         # Worktree on branch FEAT-123
  └── BUG-456/
      └── backend/
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Common issues and quick fixes:

- **"No repositories found"** - Check `repos_dir` in config contains git repos
- **"Worktree creation failed"** - Verify base branch exists and you have permissions
- **Theme not changing** - Use `Ctrl+P` to select theme, or check config file permissions
- **Command not found** - Run `pipx ensurepath` and restart terminal

For comprehensive troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).
